The Payment form atom is a streamlined interface that integrates with Stripe to facilitate secure payment processing for bookings. It allows users to easily enter their payment information, ensuring a smooth and efficient transaction experience at the time of booking.

Below code snippet can be used to render the Payment form atom

```js
import { PaymentForm } from "@calcom/atoms";

export default function StripePaymentForm(uid: string) {
  return (
    <main>
      <PaymentForm paymentUid={uid} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

For a demonstration of the Payment form, please refer to the video below.
